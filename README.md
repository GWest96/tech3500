This is a section of my website design projects for my Tech3500 class at Kean University.

## Project #1

- http://eve.kean.edu/~westbega/GaryHomePage.html

<b>Description:</b> This was my first project, creating my first webpage and I made it about me. Here you can find my resume, and followed by the rest of my projects on how I improved throughout the semester.

## Project #2

- http://eve.kean.edu/~westbega/GClothingInc.html

<b>Description:</b> This was the front end web design for a hypothetical clothing brand. I utilized a navigation menu with pictures within certain tabs, as well as a background where photos changed to show different types of styles.

## Project #3

- http://eve.kean.edu/~westbega/CSTW.html

<b>Description:</b> This was my completed website for a non-profit volunteer organization that I would like to start to help those in my community who suffer from mental illnesses and homelessness. This is the front end design of the website.
